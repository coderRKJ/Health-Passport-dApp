## Curated feedbacks from Community on our Project

Post our submission, we decided to get a few curated feedback from the Discord and Telegram community on how we could improve our Project.

* The health passport could be renamed as a Health Pass rather than acting as a passport NFT since it effectively acts as a gateway to an array of health services

* If the health passport concept stays, NFT as a passport has to be unique for each person and would perhaps need to take a Non-transferrable function.

* Improving the rationality behind minting the NFT. In the current design, the need for usability of the Blockchain has more room for improvement


## Conclusive plans for further timeline by our team:

* Have a divisive clarity over use of Health passport and the gateway tokens for unlocking services

* More implementational utility is needed behind the minting of NFTs as a unique item for an individual user.
